## Hi !

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at University of Mannheim. I'm interested in applied microeconomics, in particular public economics, and I currently work on behavioral social insurance topics.

Before coming to Mannheim, I completed an MSc in Quantitative Economics at LMU Munich and a BSc in Maths at Ko√ß University, Istanbul.
