## Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at University of Mannheim. I am interested in public economics, behavioral economics, labor economics and political economy. I currently work on questions around retirement and pensions.

Before coming to Mannheim, I completed an M.Sc. in Quantitative Economics at LMU Munich and Bachelors in Mathematics and Economics at Koç University, Istanbul.
