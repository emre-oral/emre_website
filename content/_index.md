## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at University of Mannheim. I am interested in public economics, behavioral economics, labor economics and political economy. I currently work on questions around social security and retirement.

Before coming to Mannheim, I completed an M.Sc. in Quantitative Economics at LMU Munich and Bachelors in Mathematics and Economics at Koç University, Istanbul. 

Here is my  __[CV](/pdf/CV_EmreOral.pdf)__ .

Please don't hesitate to reach out!
